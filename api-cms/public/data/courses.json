        "instructor-copy": "<h2>How I nearly lost a client (and got cursed out in the process)...</h2><p>In the early days, I was a design freelancer running low-budget jobs. I’d pick up work from platforms like oDesk, my personal network (thanks, Grandma), and the scraps from other agencies and studios.</p><p>To make ends meet, I had to take on far too many projects at once. In fact, when I first spoke to Chris Do, I’d been running 53 clients simultaneously, each with at least one active project.</p><p>I didn’t believe I could charge higher rates, so I thought the solution was to work faster. To get more done. I became obsessed with productivity, and I started exploring project management software with the hopes of finding something that would allow me to take on more work.</p><p>But one person can only do so much.</p><p>Admittedly, the work wasn’t great in those days. I wasn’t clear about my process, and I wasn’t fantastic at communicating. My clients weren’t having a great experience at all, but they didn’t complain much because I was so affordable.</p><p>Until one day…</p><p>I was working with a client on an ecommerce site build. It was one of my first completely custom Wordpress templates, and as far as I knew, the project was moving along smoothly. We finished the design phase and were well within the development phase when everything exploded.</p><p>I was in the middle of presenting the first round of the developed template when the client spoke up and asked for a design change that would have scrapped our entire build.</p><p>I scrambled for words, and explained that we couldn’t move backwards with the project, and that the change they wanted would require us to rebuild the entire site. The mood in the room went dark.</p><p>“THIS is the website? You already built it?!”</p><p>I sat, bewildered, while they fully expressed their opinion of me, expletives and all. It was the first and last time a client raised their voice at me.</p><p>Now, there are a ton of lessons I learned from this experience, especially how to avoid toxic clients like this one. Never again. But the fact remains: The client had no idea where we were in the process.</p><p>Even though each project phase was listed in the contract, and we had approval forms signed before moving on to the next phase… I must have not been been clear on how things were supposed to work.</p><p>More transparency might have helped. Having a place where they could log in and see what we’ve done so far and what’s coming next… this also might have helped. Recaps and notes from each meeting might have helped as well.</p><p>The way I worked with clients had to change.</p><p>I hunted for an affordable project management software that could help prevent disasters like this one. I tried nearly all of the major platforms available at that time. None of them really fit well.</p><p>Over time, my business grew. I learned how to price my work better, and my projects started to require specialists, so I began collaborating with other freelancers. I learned how to work with other people and, after a while, I hired my first intern. Delegation was an entirely new world. My internal team eventually grew to five employees, and I found myself doing more managing than making.</p><p>With each collaboration and with every hire, I found myself reevaluating the way we worked. The tools that worked for one person didn’t seem to work for two. And what worked for two fell flat when the team grew to five. We outgrew each platform, each process with every milestone.</p><p>Then I got hired at Blind</p><p>Have you ever seen those videos of people jumping onto a treadmill that’s moving at high speed? That’s what joining the team at Blind felt like. Watching Chris Do, Matthew Encina, and Greg Gunn work was like drinking through a fire hose.</p><p>One thing took me by surprise: Even at this high-performing agency, we still weren’t happy with the tools that we used to manage the business. In the span of four years, we changed project and team management systems several times… and never found something that fit just right.</p><p>That’s why I’m so excited at what we’ve created here. I’ve poured every ounce of experience I have into this product. I wanted to create something that would have been the a perfect fit for a growing creative business. Something that would help me manage projects, track sales performance, streamline content creation, and keep a roster of people at hand.</p><p>Most importantly, I wanted this to be something that people could learn from. A useful tool that you can pick up our project management methodology, but something that was highly customizable and adapts to your business as it grows.</p><p>I’m proud to say that’s what we’ve done here.</p><p>And I say we because I couldn’t have done this alone. My co-conspirator on this project is Joel Shaw, our Product Lead here at The Futur. Joel has been instrumental in systematizing all of our operations here at The Futur when it comes to creating our products. He’s built our own operating system in Notion, and our growing team of twenty-plus incredible humans use this on a daily basis across the globe.</p><p>When you sign up, you won’t just get another Notion template. You’ll get a flexible, customizable, and adaptable tool backed by our experience running projects and teams for clients. It’s something that will grow with you, from Freelance to running a team.</p><p>I’m excited to see what you think!</p><p>PS. I did end up finishing that project. After receiving an apology and a bit of extra money, of course, we built a site that still stands today.</p>",

Everything about how type works fell into place.</p><p>This was the big moment that shifted my thinking and understanding of design. Notice I didn't write typography—I mean <em>design</em>. I saw how the fundamentals of type could be incorporated into all facets of design.</p><p>Coming out of ArtCenter, I landed my first professional job at an advertising agency. In less than a year, I went from earning $40,000 salary to $85,000—not just because of typography, but because of how I applied its principles to all areas of design to create really good work.</p><p>It was through my understanding of type that I was able to manipulate information, as well as how it was used, to evoke certain feelings and create impact.</p><p>Here’s the thing about type: it’s not about choosing a typeface or certain font. It’s about learning how to make good use out of the tools you have.</p><p>Just like a chef in the kitchen, or a photographer in a studio, it’s their tools that allow them to do their jobs well and improve their skillsets.</p><p>My belief is that when you understand how to use type, you master how to lay things out on a page that creates a perfect harmony. Everything begins to work together beautifully when you familiarize yourself with the principles of typography and apply them to your practice.</p><p>This course is the culmination of everything I learned throughout my studies at ArtCenter.

Not too big of a market, and not too narrow. Find the market for your service that’s just right.</p><h3>Build Your Awareness</h3><h4>You want to be where your people are</h4><p>Know where your clients are hanging out so you can go to them instead of relying on clients randomly finding you.</p><h3>Eliminate the Competition</h3><h4>Capitalize on Opportunities</h4><p>Who’s your competition? Who are they neglecting? What opportunities are they missing out on? Work through exercises with Chris to develop a space that your business will dominate.</p><h3>Plan Your Marketing</h3><h4>Map out your customer journey</h4><p>Develop a roadmap that will turn prospects into clients through permission marketing strategies without an ad-spend budget.</p><p>‍</p><h1>Who is this for?</h1><h3>Whether your just launching your service-based business or scaling your agency, this course will make it easier for you to get found, and once you’re found, give leads a reason to care.</h3><p>One of the things that was missing from my flagship program, Business Bootcamp, was the ability the find clients. You can be an expert at sales and negotiation and pricing, but those skills are irrelevant if you aren’t generating a consistent stream of qualified leads.</p><p>So I did a deep dive and made sure that my own strategies for attracting clients aligned with today’s marketing thought leaders. And my theories were confirmed- you need to be super specific about who you are, who you serve, and why it should matter.</p><p>If you narrow down your target, you’ll be able to speak to leads in a more authentic way. They’ll feel understood. They’ll feel taken care of.</p><p>So don’t be afraid to make the difficult business decision of specializing. Make a commitment to serving a very specific industry with a very specific type of service. This is how you’ll gain authority, build expertise, ad grow your business.</p><p>‍</p>",

At that moment, I fell in love with numbers and what they could do.</p><p>Over the past 30 years, I've learned so much about bookkeeping—so much more than a school book could teach. I've learned that once you really get into it, it’s definitely not as scary as it seems. Even if you're not good with numbers, it can be easy. There are so many books, courses, and websites that explain bookkeeping in detail. All those details have a downside, though, because if you're not careful, you'll get overwhelmed.</p><p>There are plenty of preconceived notions about bookkeepers and what they do. I can tell you we don't have little pocket protectors or wear little rimmed glasses. What we do have in common is love for what we do.</p><p>And I’d love the opportunity to share this love of numbers with you so you can understand your books.</p><p>Whether you have your own business or are just keeping track of your personal finances, bookkeeping already exists in your life. So, why not get to know it a bit more? Why wouldn't you want to know what your own numbers tell you? And why pay a bookkeeper to do something as simple as inputting your deposits in a software?</p><p>When I started working in this industry, I never imagined how many people I would run into that didn't understand what I did for a living. They would always cringe when I mentioned I worked with numbers all day long.</p><p>&quot;Why would you do that?&quot; &quot;Do you really like that?&quot; &quot;Oh no, I hate numbers.”</p><p>Once I defined bookkeeping in a way that would click, they'd always end up asking questions regarding their own finances. I’ve always tried to make it as easy as possible to understand and explain all aspects in detail.</p><p>Does bookkeeping really have to be hard? I say it doesn't!

We became known for the content of our portfolio—like the visual effects for in the music video for &quot;Crazy&quot; by Gnarls Barkley—and were sought after for that type of work.</p><p>As time went on, competition flooded the market, and suddenly there were more options to choose from than our studio.</p><p>The internet disrupted TV advertising dollars. Lowering the demand for the work we made, and the average budget size for projects.</p><p>We were slowly becoming obsolete.</p><p>In 2015, we repositioned Blind from a motion design studio to a brand strategy design consultancy to fill the gap in the market between strategic thinking and solid design execution.</p><p>We shot up to page one of the search results for &quot;brand strategy.&quot; Clients came to us searching for solutions to bigger problems—<em>with bigger budgets</em>.</p><p>As the world changed, we adapted to it. We were able to keep the lights on and our doors open through challenging, life-changing events: the dot-com bubble burst, 9/11, the recession of 2008, the fall of TV advertising, and more.</p><p>We pivoted time and time again, successfully moving with the market, while many of our competitors had to shut down.</p><p>We stayed in demand because of our positioning.</p><p>My goal throughout this course is to teach you how to put your business in front of the right people, in the right place, and at the right time. When you define your niche and nail your positioning statement, clients will see your business as the one-and-only for them, and keep you in demand, no matter how the world's turning.</p><p>If you're ready to position your creative business above the look-alikes and consistently attract better clients, I'm excited to show you how.</p>",

I figured it out along the way.</p><p>I experimented with everything: charging by the hour, basing prices on pure guesses and gut instincts, or bidding on projects without the full scope of work entailed.</p><p>Every time I priced my work, I basically took wild guesses. Not surprisingly, these tactics didn't last long.</p><p>When I first opened Blind in 1995, I thought had a good grasp on how to price creative services. But something was still missing.</p><p>It wasn't until I met a producer in Los Angeles who showed me his bidding spreadsheet where everything clicked. It was a <em>major</em> epiphany and turning point in my career.</p><p>I realized all the things I wasn't charging for, like computers, meals, project management, client communication, or hiring freelancers. I never considered charging for <em>everything</em> I was responsible for on top of the creative work.</p><p>I learned that if I wanted my business to continue growing, <strong>I had to charge more.</strong> I figured out what was enough for our business to profit and scale over time.</p><p>I learned how to determine what was valuable to clients and price accordingly.</p><p>Our studio started earning big-budget projects worth over a million dollars. Blind became one of the more successful studios in the competitive market of LA.</p><p>It took me two decades of experimenting and refining my pricing structure to get it right, but it shouldn’t for you. Inside Painless Pricing, I'm showing you everything I've learned about pricing creativity: from the mistakes I made as a freelancer to the wins my team and I at Blind achieved with globally-recognized clients.</p><p>I’ll teach you the range of ways to charge, from hourly estimates to project rates, and how to price the client—<em>not</em> the work you do.</p><p>You'll finally know what works for your business so you can price your work the right way and make more money doing what you love.</p>",

That's how fast I was driving when I saw it.</p><p>It was autumn in rural Virginia on a highway just outside of Richmond. Glowering above the golden tree canopy, a billboard buzzed across my windshield.</p><p>I only caught a glimpse of what was on the billboard, but immediately my stomach twisted into a knot. I turned the truck around as quickly as possible, hoping that my eyes deceived me.</p><p>On my second look, I slowed to a stop. I sat there, on the side of the road, staring at the billboard in disbelief.</p><p>There, for all the world to see, was a logo I had carefully designed the year prior. But it was barely recognizable. Horizontally squished. Drop shadow. Pattern fill. Slapped on top of a busy photograph.</p><p>I couldn't believe it.</p><p>It wasn't just the fact that I had worked hard on the logo. It wasn't even my best work. I was early in my career. What stung the most? That project was a tough one. The client wanted to get it just right. Revision after revision of minuscule changes... led to the monstrosity on the other side of my window.</p><p>I'm sure we've all been there.</p><p>You do great work, only to see it months or years later... destroyed.</p><p>It's a sinking feeling. I know we're not supposed to be affected by what the client does with the services we provide... but, c'mon. It hurts.</p><p>At that moment, I knew I needed to find a way to future-proof my work. I wanted to set my clients up for success, even if they didn't work with me after the initial project was completed.</p><p>Sometimes the universe answers when asked.</p><p>The very next day, I landed a project for The Hyatt hotel. During our onboarding call, I was sent the Hyatt Style Guide: guidelines for working with their brand when designing marketing collateral.</p><p>I was blown away.</p><p>This was it. This was the missing piece of the puzzle! Flipping through the pages of the style guide, I knew exactly what sandbox I could play in as a collateral designer:</p><ul><li>How to use their logo</li><li>What typefaces were acceptable at different sizes</li><li>How to use and combine their brand colors</li><li>What secondary palettes were acceptable</li></ul><p>But they took their brand book even further. They went beyond simple layout guidelines. They provided guidance for every creative who may touch their brand:</p><ul><li>Marketers</li><li>Copywriters</li><li>Photographers</li><li>Printers</li></ul><p>The guidebook was so complete, I vowed to never simply deliver a folder of logo files again. Since that day, I've delivered more than a few identity projects and left every single client with a comprehensive style guide.</p><p>I know, it seems like a no-brainer, but let me tell you from experience: delivering logo, branding, or identity work without a style guide is rolling the dice. You know what I mean if you've ever:</p><ul><li>Seen your work in the wild... and wondered what the heck happened</li><li>Received calls from clients wondering where to find design assets months or years later</li><li>Had a client ask &quot;What's an .ai file?&quot; after printing 5,000 t-shirts</li><li>Handed off work to an internal design team</li></ul><p>I get it! I was there. And while not all clients are perfect, and internal teams don't always execute your vision to the letter, I'm proud to say I haven't seen any more mangled work.</p><p>Brand Style Guide Kit is the result of my 10+ years as an identity design lead, from freelance projects to running branding projects here at Blind. It's an easy-to-use, done-for-you template that has everything you need to deliver branding projects successfully.</p><p>This is the exact template that I've used to:</p><ul><li>Deliver branding projects priced between $40,000 and $250,000+</li><li>Help startups grow a brand from the garage to tens of millions in revenue</li><li>Help small businesses create brands that last</li></ul><p>You'll have access to everything: a template file in multiple formats, a guidebook that walks you through the creation process, and an extensive text swipe file that you can use to copy and paste verbiage into your style guides. It's everything that I wished I had when I started working in branding.</p><p>Ready to get started?</p><p>When you're finished with the Brand Style Guide Kit, you won't just have another template file sitting on your hard drive. You'll have a highly valuable deliverable that you can add right in to your identity projects. The Style Guide Kit will help you to:</p><ul><li>Future-proof your branding design work</li><li>Increase the perceived value of your services</li><li>Save time by standardizing your delivery process</li><li>Communicate your vision to your clients and their team</li><li>Get a team of designers on the same page, visually</li></ul><p>If you're ready to take control of the way your work is executed, and feel confident about the way you deliver your branding work, The Brand Style Guide Kit is perfect for you.</p><p>By supporting this product before launch, you'll have access to my exclusive webinar - I hope to see all of you there!</p>",

Your client gives you some key words to base your work off of: modern, clean, and simple. Surely, you know what those words mean and what they look like, and obviously the client does, too.</p><p>You both talked about it.</p><p>You break from the creative brief and get moving. For weeks, you pour your heart and soul into every little piece of this project. You’re confident that this is your best work yet. This is going to blow your client away.</p><p>Fast forward to presentation day, and you’re pumped up. You're ready to watch your client collect their jaw from the floor.</p><p>Then they utter the words that punch you right in the gut.</p><p><strong>“This isn’t what I pictured at all. This is not what we talked about. What else do you have to show me?”</strong></p><p>How is that possible? Why did they suddenly realize that what you’ve shown them isn’t what they want?</p><p>Your client didn’t just suddenly decide that—you were never aligned on the visual direction to begin with. All of a sudden, you start to feel it:</p><p>“This client is a nightmare. They don’t understand design. They don’t understand my process.”</p><p>Yes, some clients are tough. You might not always see eye to eye. But we can’t read their minds. (Even though that'd be pretty sweet.) We have to know how to speak the same language.</p><p><strong>Your process is missing something vital.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong></p><h4>What’s a Stylescapes®?</h4><p>You might know them as mood boards, style tiles, or tear sheets. A Stylescape is a curated collection of images, textures, typography, and colors that communicate a certain look and feel. It defines the visual direction and gives clients a crystal-clear picture of the deliverables ahead.</p><p>Stylescapes are designed to be shared with clients before the visual design phase to make sure everyone’s in agreement with the direction. When you and the client sign off on a modern, clean, and simple design, you have a visual reference tool to communicate exactly what that might look like.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How have Stylescapes® helped us?</h4><p><em>“Our team used to spend hours upon hours working on detailed design ideas, only to be course-corrected by clients. Clients sometimes felt uncomfortable to comment on work because of how finished everything looked. And it was always at the 11th hour that clients changed their minds.”</em></p><p><em>“Since incorporating Stylescapes, we get buy-in early on or we don’t proceed. It’s a great gut check that helps our team and clients get aligned in days, not weeks. If clients want to change something, we can quickly adjust within 24 hours. And because Stylescapes are made so quickly, we can explore a broader range of styles and approaches we wouldn’t normally try. It's been liberating to maintain our creative freedom.”</em></p><p><strong>— Chris Do, Founder and Executive Creative Director of Blind</strong></p><p>Stylescapes yield seriously positive relationships. They allow you and your client to collaborate and exchange ideas to move the project forward smoothly. Clients feel like their input and involvement is valued, and trust you'll deliver something great.</p><p><em>“Someone took the idea that I’ve been going for, and here it is on a board. And I go, ‘oh, I like that.’ This was extremely helpful for us.”</em></p><p><strong>—Josh Hamilton of Hamilton Family Brewery, a former client of Blind</strong></p><p>You might be thinking, “OK...how is this different from what I’m doing now?”</p><p>Do you sometimes feel like you and your client are from different worlds, where you just don’t get each other? Or feel nervous every time you present your designs, and let them take over when they’re not happy with what you’ve made?</p><p>Instead of making progress, you start running in a hamster wheel of revisions. It’s soul-crushing as a designer to become your client’s—or boss’s—puppet. You can’t figure out what they want, so you rely on them to tell you.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Information is bound to get lost in translation.</h4><p>You could ask clients loads of questions but never get clarity on their answers. What 'modern' means to you, could mean something completely different to them. You'd end each brief with a lot of unclear objectives.</p><p>And that won't end well. Each project then turns into a constant guessing game of trying to figure out what clients really mean.</p><p>‍</p><h4>But we can stop guessing, and start knowing.</h4><p>Stylescapes help to close the imagination gap and get clients to see what you see. Both parties can get on the same page about the design direction from the get-go, and have something to reference throughout the project.</p><p>As designers, it’s easy for us to imagine what something will look like. Sometimes it’s hard to explain our ideas without going the extra mile. But with Stylescapes, you’ll dodge unnecessary, added work and hit your client’s expectations on the mark.</p><p>If you're tired of designing with headaches and feeling trapped in an abyss of revisions, this is the course for you.</p><p>‍</p>",

Let me start from the beginning.</p><p>I went to school at ArtCenter and studied graphic design with a focus on motion design. During my time at ArtCenter, I learned what would be the foundation for just about every project I became a part of: narrative sequencing. This is the concept of using images to tell a story and communicate an idea.</p><p>Coming out of ArtCenter, I stepped straight into the motion design field and worked on a number of projects, from commercials, music videos, and content.</p><p>I’ve had to wear many different hats throughout each project as a designer, animator, and then eventually, creative director. In a sense, I was learning while on the job.</p><p>Anyone in motion design knows that visual communication is a pillar of the industry. Before I could even begin to work on projects, I had to pitch ideas and communicate them not only to clients, but internally to the people that I worked with. There, my visual communication skills were put to the test.</p><p>How could I use images, combine them with words, and piece the two together to tell a story? To sell an idea? With none other than <strong>Styleframes</strong>.</p><p>Styleframes are just juicy, beautiful, gorgeous images that tells the client or studio you work at exactly where you’re headed. They help dictate the aesthetic and define key moments in the production.</p><p>As a designer, you need to be able to use the tools at your disposal to create an image that communicates the key points of your vision. When you’re selling an idea, it’s extremely important that the image communicates, looks beautiful, and the viewer looking at it understands what you’re trying to tell them.</p><p>Styleframes combine the power of Photoshop, photo compositing, and mixing different elements together to create a moment in time that represents what the final outcome of the production will be.</p><p>If you go to design school, and you’re enrolled in a motion design program, they should be teaching you this stuff. The unfortunate truth is that not all of them do, and not all of them do it well.</p><p>But that’s where this course steps in. You will learn to clearly show the vision of your idea. You’ll be able to deliver highly rendered, quality, beautiful moments in time that help you sell your vision.</p><p>Working in this industry, we know that time is precious for everyone. When you get the opportunity to pitch your idea and share it with someone—be it a client or studio—and ultimately sell it, you want to make sure you do it right.</p><p>My hope is that when you finish the Styleframes course, you will seize every opportunity to pitch ideas, communicate them in a clear and engaging way, and produce amazing stories that sell.</p>",

They were in need of a logo, and as an aspiring designer at the time, I jumped on the opportunity.</p><p>Knowing only a fraction about logo design, I can very well say I did not do a good job. If you think about all the things that could possibly go wrong with a logo, I probably did half of them in this logo. I chose a horrible typeface, and produced something that was far from memorable.</p><p>Most of us, when we’re first starting out, think that the logo should say what it does. That very first logo I made? I thought it needed to explain everything the business did. That’s where things became messy.</p><p>It took me years to understand how logos are constructed, why you do what you do to make logos, and what they should communicate. But now I want you to avoid the mistakes I made, and grasp the best practices of logo construction.</p><p>Now in terms of what makes a logo look good, well...that’s not so cut-and-dried. But there are some basic rules to logo design. And I’ll teach you all of them, plus many more, throughout this course.</p><p>I’ve taken everything I’ve learned through a private arts education, working full-time, and servicing clients, and put together this in-depth curriculum for you to master logo design.</p><p>This course gives you the opportunity to look over the shoulders of professional designers and see how they craft beautiful, impactful logos.

I was putting things on a page without understanding how shifting something left or right affected all the components on the page.</p><p>I remember walking through the halls of ArtCenter looking at beautiful pieces of design work and thinking, &quot;One day, I will get there.&quot;</p><p>It wasn't until my third term at ArtCenter where things began to change.</p><p>I was enrolled in an art class, and it was in this class where everything that confused me about typography, suddenly made perfect sense. Everything about how type works fell into place.</p><p>This was the big moment that shifted my thinking and understanding of design. Notice I didn't write typography—I mean <em>design</em>. I saw how the fundamentals of type could be incorporated into all facets of design.</p><p>Coming out of ArtCenter, I landed my first professional job at an advertising agency. In less than a year, I went from earning $40,000 salary to $85,000—not just because of typography, but because of how I applied its principles to all areas of design to create really good work.</p><p>It was through my understanding of type that I was able to manipulate information, as well as how it was used, to evoke certain feelings and create impact.</p><p>Here’s the thing about type: it’s not about choosing a typeface or certain font. It’s about learning how to make good use out of the tools you have.</p><p>Just like a chef in the kitchen, or a photographer in a studio, it’s their tools that allow them to do their jobs well and improve their skillsets.</p><p>My belief is that when you understand how to use type, you master how to lay things out on a page that creates a perfect harmony. Everything begins to work together beautifully when you familiarize yourself with the principles of typography and apply them to your practice.</p><p>This course is the culmination of everything I learned throughout my studies at ArtCenter. It’s my hope that the dark art and mystery of typography become logical to you, so you can create amazing pieces of work and excel as a designer.</p><p>‍</p>",

But job after job, I lost to our competitors. I was only closing 1/4 opportunities, losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential revenue. Every pitch I lost shortened our business' runway.</p><p><strong>The client feedback I got as to why they didn't choose my idea went something like this:</strong></p><ul><li>“Your pitch treatment felt off brand.”</li><li>“The other companies had a better understanding of what we wanted”</li><li>“You didn’t show us how you would execute the idea.”</li><li>“You were too expensive.”</li></ul><p>I was frustrated, disappointed and began to doubt myself. I spent so many years trying to master my craft. I couldn't understand why I was losing.</p><p>I wasn’t equipped with the know-how to win a client’s business. My understanding of pitching was <strong>“the best idea wins.”</strong> But how do you define the best idea? <strong>This was the critical piece of the puzzle I was missing.</strong></p><p>I worked with a business coach, Keir McLaren, to redefine my mindset going into client meetings. Dr. Holtzman, a professor of psychology, trained me on how to ask better questions. Chris Do, the owner of Blind, mentored me on everything he knew about listening, being present, and his process for design. And I read a ton of books on buyer psychology.</p><p>A year later I won 20 out of 22 pitches. I brought in the lions share of our companies revenue –<strong>$3.9 million.</strong> I started landing the biggest clients of my life, like <a href=\"https://www.matthewencina.com/work\">Xbox and Coldplay</a>. And I stopped wasting my time chasing bad ideas. By 2014, I finally understood how to present my ideas in a valuable way to my clients. All because I knew how to surface the clients’ <strong>goals, objections, and ideas</strong> upfront – before I made anything.</p><p>I felt like I had discovered a cheat code for a video game. Pitching went from painful to pleasurable. Because I knew what questions to ask, and how to approach every pitch.</p><p>I regained my confidence.</p><p>To my surprise, this also resulted in more alignment with my clients and my internal crew. My team was working more autonomously. And there were fewer direction changes from clients after the project started.</p><p>This personal growth had little to do with my design skills, and everything to do with how I communicated. The art of pitching isn't something that's taught in school or our careers, but it's such a critical skill in our line of work. So I feel compelled to help.</p><p>This is the framework that I’ve developed over the years of pitching in one the most competitive creative fields. It's simple, flexible, and effective.</p><p>So what do you say—are you ready to land more clients?</p>",

We called it “Build up Lettering”.</p><p>It involved three to four pencil renderings on tracing paper. Each tracing would be progressively refined toward a more exact version. It was a tedious and time consuming process, but therapeutic at the same time.</p><p>Little did I know, we were making the type then.</p><p>Lettering taught me how to see shape, proportion, and curve like nothing else. I could bend it, shape it and manipulate it from an informed place.</p><p>Learning to draw type has given me the power to make my type expressive without being enslaved by the grid or severe geometry that so often hobbles young designers.</p><p>Trends come and go. The current approach to custom typography is producing mostly letterforms that are geometrically aggressive and difficult to read. They may be interesting but, more often than not, are created to impress other designers.</p><p>Understanding of the organic nuances of hand-drawn letterforms allows you to create logos and brands that are warm, user-friendly and familiar—all while being unique and trademarkable.</p><p>I believe we should design for the masses and respect that audience. The “Chop and scale” approach with prefabricated type can only take you so far. Eventually your incompetence will show. What do you do when that happens?</p><p>Start with lettering.</p><p>When you have a client that needs an old logo refreshed, you’re the go-to-person for the job. When you could use some flourishes, decorative elements, dimensionality, you’ll know what to do and more importantly, HOW to do it without embarrassing yourself.</p><p>This course will show you that your body is far more capable of making beautiful images than your computer is.</p><p>You will be able to make grounded visual judgements as you begin your journey into a timeless craft of drawing and designing letterforms.</p>",

I understood how large businesses, such as Fortune 500 companies, were keeping track of their finances, but I didn’t yet know how smaller businesses were doing this.</p><p>It wasn’t until I began teaching at ArtCenter that I slowly started to discover and understand the financial needs of designers. I decided to teach my students how to manage their money so they could grow their creative businesses, and filled the gap where design schools were lacking. I developed an easy-to-use, easy-to-learn system for my students that made them more comfortable with the subject of money.</p><p>This course is that same curriculum.</p><p>Managing Money was designed to help you, the creative, reduce risk and fear with the application of the easy-to-use tools. It is meant to help you gain back control of your financial life, and have a set of metrics that continuously allows you to manage your finances in both your business and personal life.</p><p>Learning to set budgets and build financial independence also allows you to invest more easily and create wealth along the way.</p><p>Within each module, you will begin to feel a sense of independence and motivation, and successfully manage your finances.</p><p>This course does exactly what I did for my clients; providing hundreds of creatives and creative firms with financial management and control. And now, it’s time I teach the same principles to you, so you can pave the way towards a financially secure future.</p>",

A one-man-band doing everything myself. If I'm being honest, I was figuring it out as I was going along. For those of you who know my story, you know that they were tough times.</p><p>See, back then, I was making $3 per hour.</p><p>While I wasn't really confident enough to ask for more, there was one other reason why I wound up making so little:</p><p><strong>I had no process.</strong></p><p>I used to onboard a client to do a $50 logo, and it would be a completely new venture. I reinvented the wheel with every project. I just kinda went with the flow. This wound up flowing me right into <strong>no money</strong>. And with goals of starting a family, this started to stress me out in a major way.</p><p><strong>I don't think I'm alone here. I struggled with things like:</strong></p><ul><li>Clients asking for more and more revisions</li><li>Not getting paid on time, or ever</li><li>Unhappy clients at the end of the project</li><li>Not knowing when or how to hire people or delegate work</li></ul><p>I can't tell you how much referral work I probably missed out on because I didn't standardize my approach.</p><p>I knew I needed to improve things, but I had no idea where to start. I looked up project management online... what a Google search, right?! There are so many different methodologies out there, so many different tools, and so many different opinions about how projects should be run, it was confusing to say the least.</p><p>If you're like me, you need a practical project management framework that actually saves time**.** Luckily, <strong>you’re in the right place.</strong></p><p>Eventually, working with clients became a well-oiled machine. I was able to give them transparency and access while still maintaining control over the relationship.</p><p><strong>That was, until, I started working with Matthew Encina.</strong></p><p>Watching Matthew lead an internal team is like watching a an experienced conductor guide a well-rehearsed orchestra. Seriously: he's Maestro status.</p><p>The more we collaborated on projects, the more I noticed our approaches overlap and eventually, we were left with a framework that wins: every. single. time. Our combined approach is really where the magic happens. And we've outlined it all right here in this course.</p><p>This is the project management approach that we've used to manage million-dollar projects for clients like XBOX, AARP, Hudson Pacific Properties and more.</p><p>When you're finished with Practical Project Management, you won't just have a philosophy to think about. You'll have actionable, tactical steps that are industry-proven and work, regardless of what project management software you choose to use.</p><p>If you're ready to make the most of every project, have time to do the work you really want to do, and start to scale your business by delegating, Practical Project Management will be great for you.</p><p>‍</p>",

The budget he listed on the job was $60.</p><p>I submitted my application for—you guessed it—$60.</p><p>A few days later, I heard back from the entrepreneur with a counteroffer...of $40.

That was terrifying.</p><p>Even when we agreed on a budget range on the phone, and I felt great about the phone call, I still had so many unanswered questions about putting a proposal together... things like:</p><ul><li>What kind of proposals do bigger studios put together?</li><li>Is this proposal too long? Is it too short?</li><li>Should the client sign the proposal?</li><li>How do I structure my price so that the client doesn't negotiate?</li><li>What does the client actually want to see?</li></ul><p>I say this a lot: I learn by getting punched in the face.

In fact, it took me a long time, and a lot of lost revenue to figure things out.</p><p>I honestly had no idea how much timing had to do with getting proposals won. I didn't know that asking for a proposal is an easy way for a client to say no. Not to mention putting proposals together that didn't work!</p><p>I get it. I really do. And I've learned these lessons the hard way.

        "instructor-copy": "<h3>It seems simple, but without a framework, case studies are hard to create.</h3><p>I can remember just starting out as a freelance designer. I was struggling to make ends meet and I was just trying to find anyone who would pay me to create. Those were tough times.</p><p>I remember whenever someone asked me for my website or portfolio. I would give them the link or send them the PDF… then follow it up with a whole list of excuses:</p><ul><li>My site’s down right now, we’re just going through a rebrand</li><li>We’ve been so busy, we haven’t been able to update things in a while</li><li>Just a heads up: most of the work up there is student work</li></ul><p><strong>Any of those sound familiar?</strong></p><p>Every once in a while, I’d crack open my portfolio website to update things and add new projects… and sit staring at the blank text window, wondering what to write. Or I’d open the project-final-FINAL-r23 folder, and wonder how the hell I was supposed to share the client-butchered results with the world. Especially when my first attempts were so much better.</p><p>To be honest, I wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed back in those days. In fact, I’m still far from perfect.</p><p>But I’ve learned a few things since then, albeit from the school of hard knocks, which I’m dying to share with you. Minus the hard knocks, of course.</p><p>I used to think that if I did great work for clients, more work would follow. That if I just did my best and focused on my craft, that bigger clients would eventually find me.</p><p><strong>Boy, was I wrong.</strong></p><p>I tried my best to present client work that sometimes I wasn’t even proud of. But my portfolio looked like a dirty laundry basket full of random, mismatched projects.</p><p>And the project pages themselves? They came off boring at best. Just a page full of dull imagery, isolated logos, and a basic description.</p><p>I struggled with the consequences of my portfolio for years:</p><ul><li>Losing jobs that should have been mine</li><li>Not getting past the first phone call</li><li>Not hearing back after sending my portfolio to new leads</li><li>Never winning jobs on oDesk (Upwork) or other job sites</li></ul><p>I was close to throwing in the towel and getting a job. I wanted to quit. And then I realized something that changed everything.</p><p><strong>I realized that most clients can’t see.</strong></p><p>I mean they’re not blind (usually), but when it comes to analyzing aesthetics and determining who’s work is better than the rest… they can’t do it. At least not well.</p><p>You see, they’re not trained professionals like you and I. They don’t spend their time studying what craftmanship looks like.</p><p>And if they don’t see something in your portfolio that’s pretty damn close to what they’re looking for, they move on.</p><p><strong>Unless we present our work differently.</strong></p><p>Story, process, and assurance are more powerful than aesthetics, styles, and trends. So when we share our work, we need to:</p><ul><li>capture their attention with a compelling story of solving a unique problem,</li><li>help them envision working with you as an amazing experience they will love</li><li>assure them that the end result will achieve the real results they’re after</li></ul><p>The best way to hit all three? <strong>A compelling case study.</strong> Case studies are the way we can present our work by telling the story of the project.</p><p>This is the framework that I’ve developed over the years of writing case studies: it’s a fast, flexible, and easy framework that you can use to craft case studies that help you land bigger clients.</p><p>When you’re finished with this guidebook, you won’t just have great case studies. You’ll know how to use them. But best of all, you will uncover insights about your own process and clients.</p><p>‍</p>",

I remember even Googling the word “strategy” on a phone call with one of our first clients.</p><p>See, in design school, we were trained to do the making, not the strategy. Each time clients handed us a brief, we’d put something together that fit the specifications. But almost every client would have us run back and forth to the drawing board because what we made “just wasn’t there.”</p><p>After many, many loops, it hit me: I didn’t have context into their own strategy.</p><p>How could I understand what they wanted and needed? How could I understand their problems just from a piece of paper? Without the right questions or context, I couldn’t.</p><p>That was, until, I created CORE Discovery. I started driving the strategy process for clients and getting crystal clear context. I sat down with clients and asked them what problem they were currently facing. Soon enough, the revisions shrank, the relationships grew stronger, and the work got better.</p><p>It’s a habit of designers to fall into the aesthetics of things. I know because I’ve done this so many times before.</p><p>But now with CORE Discovery, I get clients and stakeholders aligned from the first meeting, I have a clear understanding of their pain points, and I’m able to produce a plan that exceeds their goals.</p><p>This framework has become a vital piece of my process, and my hope is that it does the same for you, too.</p>",

And although I am comfortable pairing and working with all the colors of the rainbow, it wasn’t always like that.</p><p>In fact, if I scroll back through my Instagram timeline I gradually start to cringe more and more. What was I thinking using those colors together? How come I didn’t add more contrast? And why have I not deleted this yet?</p><p>Color has always been this mysterious and unknown skill to me. I’d look at my favorite illustrator’s work and marvel at their palettes. And then, I’d compare that to my work, followed by a long, slow sigh. Not even close.</p><p>You see, I went to design school. I took out loans and I paid the exorbitant tuition. And though I left with quite strong technical skills, I lacked some important fundamentals that continued to haunt me throughout my career.</p><p><em>Color</em> was the big one.</p><p>I had some design sense and I could draw nice-looking shapes on occasion, but the biggest difference between where my work was and where I wanted it to be was--you guessed it--color. To this day, I still go through rounds and rounds of options trying to decide on what color would work best. It’s a problem, I know.</p><p>It took me a long time to realize this, but my color problem was not a technical one—I simply did not understand how to <em>see color</em>. And by see I mean, understand the purpose and context of color.</p><p>If you think about it, it’s kind of like typography. When done well, you don’t really notice anything wrong with it. But if not done well, you’re left with a feeling of confusion and discomfort.</p><p>So, while on my color-filled, educational journey I began taking notes. Saving bookmarks. Spending too much on books thanks to Amazon Prime. I was on a mission to understand color. And for the record, I still am.</p><p>Which brings me to this course, <em>Color For Creatives</em>. They say you should make work that you wish existed and that is entertaining to you. So, that’s what I did. This is the course about color that I wish existed back when I was first learning. It’s a blend of theory, contemporary analysis and hands-on work so you can learn the principles and then practice applying them to your everyday tasks.</p><p>Look, color is not easy. It’s a subjective experience for most of us. But it doesn’t have to be impossibly difficult. My goal is to make your color choices less arbitrary and equip you with the confidence and know-how to start making better ones.</p>",
